# APIs
Application Programming Interface
---

Concept: Set of clearnly defined methods of communication between various software components. An API can be for a web-based system, operating system, database system, computer hardware or software library. 

Purpose: APIs abstract the underlying implementation and only expose objects or actions developers need, thereby simplifying programming. An API might give the developer a function that copies a file from one location to another without requiring that the developer understand the file system operations occuring behind the scenes.
